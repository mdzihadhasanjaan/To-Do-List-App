# ‚úçÔ∏è Technical Implementation

**Frontend:**  
- React.js (JavaScript library for UI)
- Axios and Fetch API for HTTP requests
- React Router DOM for page navigation
- Deployed on Render (Static Hosting)

**Backend:**  
- Node.js with Express.js server
- MongoDB Atlas for cloud database
- JWT Authentication for security
- Deployed on Render Web Service

**Architecture Decisions:**  
- Separated frontend and backend
- Used RESTful API structure
- Protected routes with authentication middleware

---

# üöÇ Development Process

- **Phase 1:** Designed UI prototypes, user personas, and technical requirements.
- **Phase 2:** Developed basic backend (Express.js server, MongoDB connection).
- **Phase 2:** Built frontend login/register pages with React.js.
- **Phase 2:** Integrated backend APIs with frontend.
- **Phase 2:** Full stack connection between frontend and backend (Token handling).
- **Phase 2:** Deployment to Render and final polishing.
- **Phase 4:** Presentation preparation and documentation.

# ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and Future Work

**What worked well:**
- Full authentication flow (registration, login, secure token storage).
- Cloud hosting made the app easily accessible.
- Good separation between frontend and backend.

**Challenges faced:**
- CORS errors during development (solved using CORS middleware).
- Handling protected routes and token expiry securely.

**Future improvements:**
- Add Password Reset feature
- Task filtering and sorting options
- Better error messages for the user
